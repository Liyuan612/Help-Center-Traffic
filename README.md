# Help-Center-Traffic
For business, it’s important that we oﬀer scalable ways for our users
to resolve their issues on their own. One way in which we achieve this is by hosting a Help
Center with articles about the most common issues that our customers contact us about. A key
performance indicator that we track over time is the Help Center escalation rate, which we use
to understand how eﬀective the Help Center is in deflecting support tickets. In this project,
I will analyze the help center traffic data.
